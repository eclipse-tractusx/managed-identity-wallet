# Introduction to Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)

In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital interactions and data exchange, the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (
SSI) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm shift. SSI represents a departure from traditional identity management
systems, placing individuals at the center of control over their own identity information in the digital realm.

Unlike conventional identity models, where centralized entities like governments, corporations, or service providers
store and manage user information, SSI empowers individuals with the authority to own, control, and share their personal
data on their terms. This revolutionary approach is rooted in principles of privacy, security, and user autonomy, aiming
to address the inherent challenges and vulnerabilities associated with centralized identity systems.

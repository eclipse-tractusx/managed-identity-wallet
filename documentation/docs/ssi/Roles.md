# SSI Roles

Overview of Roles in SSI:

1. **Issuer:**
    - The Issuer is a key participant in the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) ecosystem responsible for creating and
      issuing verifiable credentials. These credentials represent specific identity attributes of an individual, such as
      a driver's license or a university degree. The Issuer cryptographically signs these credentials, establishing
      trust and authenticity. Examples of issuers could include government entities, educational institutions, or
      organizations verifying specific attributes.

2. **Holder:**
    - The Holder is the individual or entity that possesses and controls the verifiable credentials issued to them.
      Unlike traditional identity systems, where data is stored centrally, in SSI, the Holder maintains their
      credentials in a decentralized manner. This decentralized control empowers individuals to decide when, where, and
      with whom they share their identity attributes. The Holder actively manages their digital identity on their terms,
      enhancing privacy and control.

3. **Verifier:**
    - The Verifier is an entity or service seeking to authenticate the identity of an individual. Verifiers use
      cryptographic methods to confirm the validity of presented verifiable credentials without the need for direct
      access to a centralized database. This process allows for secure and privacy-preserving identity verification.
      Verifiers could be service providers, employers, or any entity requiring proof of specific attributes without the
      need to store personal data centrally.

In the SSI framework, these three roles collaborate to establish a decentralized, secure, and user-centric approach to
identity management, providing a flexible and trust-based system for digital interactions.
